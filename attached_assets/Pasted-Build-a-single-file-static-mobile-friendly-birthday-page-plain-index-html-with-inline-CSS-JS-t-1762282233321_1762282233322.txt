Build a single-file, static, mobile-friendly birthday page (plain index.html with inline CSS & JS) that uses the assets at assets/soheli.jpg and assets/happy_birthday.mp3. Keep the project lightweight and ready to run on Replit. Focus on a fast, delightful reveal experience — no admin panels, no secret inputs, no download feature.

Core behavior

Try to auto-play assets/happy_birthday.mp3 on page load. If the browser blocks autoplay, show a clear overlay button: 🔊 Tap to Play Music that starts the audio and runs the reveal.

When audio starts (auto or via tap), trigger:

a confetti burst (use canvas-confetti or a small JS confetti routine),

the main reveal animation (photo sharpens & scales, headline animates, message fades in),

an optional subtle pulse around the photo synced roughly to the music beat.

Provide a Play Surprise 🎉 big button as the manual reveal fallback (keeps existing UX).

Add a Replay Music button that restarts the song and retriggers confetti.

Provide a visible Mute / Unmute icon and a simple volume slider (0–100%) in the top-right — easy to spot and use.

Layout & visuals

Full-screen gradient background (pink → orange → yellow) with subtle floating emoji/balloon effects.

Center card with rounded corners containing:

Title: Happy Birthday, Soheli! 🥳

Subtitle: Made with love and a little bit of code 💻❤️

Circular photo using assets/soheli.jpg (alt text: Soheli smiling)

Short message:
Wishing you a year full of sunshine, laughter, and cake. — Junaid

Keep fonts modern (Poppins or Inter via Google Fonts) and spacing airy. Make buttons large and touch-friendly.

Optional memory carousel

If assets/mem1.jpg, assets/mem2.jpg, assets/mem3.jpg exist, show a small auto-rotating carousel beneath the main photo with captions. If not present, hide the carousel.

CONFIG (single block at top of the file — Replit should leave this editable)

const CONFIG = {
  name: "Soheli",
  from: "Junaid",
  photo: "assets/soheli.jpg",
  audio: "assets/happy_birthday.mp3",
  message: "Wishing you a year full of sunshine, laughter, and cake. — Junaid",
  memPhotos: ["assets/mem1.jpg","assets/mem2.jpg","assets/mem3.jpg"]
};


Accessibility & performance

Buttons must be keyboard-focusable with visible focus outlines.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion (reduce or disable heavy animation if set).

Lazy-load carousel images and compress assets where possible.

Provide graceful fallback if soheli.jpg is missing (show initials “S” in a circle).

Deliverables

A runnable Replit project with a single index.html (inline CSS + JS), assets/ folder placeholders, and a short README that explains:

Where to drop the photo: assets/soheli.jpg

Where to drop the audio: assets/happy_birthday.mp3

How to change CONFIG values

Note about browser autoplay: “If audio is blocked, press the big 🔊 Tap to Play Music overlay.”

Keep it simple — no admin PINs, no secret inputs, no download button, no extra button labels I didn’t ask for. Prioritize: autoplay + graceful fallback → reveal + confetti → replay/mute/volume → optional carousel.
